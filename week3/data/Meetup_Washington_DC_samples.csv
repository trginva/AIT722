ride contain zero calories We have been tasked with gathering additional data and doing our own research to substantiate or challenge the above conclusion This is a casual paced ride of about 10 mph pace / 10 miles distance and is a No Drop ride The route is a loop that takes quiet neighborhood streets from the shop to the I-395 fly-over to Shirlington and on to the Four Mile Run Trail and Mount

mass transportation Washington DC has long been called the City of Trees Despite a net tree-cover loss of roughly 60 percent since 1980 the name still applies The parks remain mostly wooded Residential streets yards and gardens sport canopies of leaves Vacant lots rights-of-way and nooks quickly follow suit if left alone This hike celebrates the District's arboreal heritage We pass the zoo and if others are interested we can spend some time there as well It winds through the well-wooded parklands and residential areas of Northwest Washington Administratively the parklands are all part of the National Park Service's Rock Creek Park However like the hike they also include four separate units Melvin Hazen Glover-Archbold Whitehaven and Dumbarton Oaks Parks Most of the trees along the hike route are deciduous such as oaks hickories maples dogwoods and sycamores Hikers will also find more exotic varieties along the way with wildflowers and birds adding further color and interest
